Q: Who made this?  
A: me  

Q: When was this game made?  
A: Between December 2019 and Janurary 2020. Reworked the jump in July 2020.

Q: What challenges came about when creating this?  
A: I had never used Unity before this, nor had I used CSharp.  

Q: What things inspired/ helped you to make this?  
A: Brakeys youtube channel helped out a lot as well as Unity's tutorials. Metroidvainias such as Cave Story and Hollow Knight were a big inspriation. I like their large maps-- and the feeling of exploration they bring. I also like how you, as a player, become stronger and stronger as you progress. I wanted to create a similar feeling. Nicktoons: Battle for Volcano Island for the GameBoy was an inspiration for some of the game mechanics, such as the 'zap ability' (similar to Danny Phantom's ghost ability).  

Q: Where is the code?  
Go to Assets->Scripts, and there I have written everything... except for the meta files.

Q: How can I load this on Unity?  
Download these files. In the Unity Hub, click Add, and choose the Anti file. The lastest Unity version is ok.
